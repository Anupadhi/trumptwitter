So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous &amp; corrupt people who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!
One of the reasons that Fake News has become so prevalent &amp; far reaching is the fact that corrupt ‚Äújournalists‚Äù base their stories on SOURCES that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story. When you see ‚Äúfive sources say‚Äù don‚Äôt believe the story it is....
....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that the media would be trusted again and Fake News would largely be a thing if the past!

‚ÄúPresident Trump is a ratings hit. Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news roughly the viewership of the season finale of ‚ÄòThe Bachelor.‚Äô Numbers are continuing to rise...
...On Monday nearly 12.2 million people watched Mr. Trump‚Äôs briefing on CNN Fox News and MSNBC according to Nielsen ‚Äî ‚ÄòMonday Night Football‚Äô numbers. Millions more are watching on ABC CBS NBC and online streaming sites and the audience is expanding. On Monday Fox News...
...alone attracted 6.2 million viewers for the president‚Äôs briefing ‚Äî an astounding number for a 6 p.m. cable broadcast more akin to the viewership for a popular prime-time sitcom...
